# @summationai/axe-surface

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- WebMCP without a relay, headless: `axe host --dev --webmcp --stdio` serves a page's own WebMCP tools to a desktop agent from headless Chromium, with the person asked before high-risk controls (a host-delivered approver, [S-WEB-6]) and the page's own tool hints. `exposeWebMcp(surface, { granularity: "domain" })` offers a fixed tool set taking entry ids (`surface_navigate`, `surface_set-field`, `surface_run-control`, `surface_load-more`) with an observe tool that filters and pages ([S-WEB-7]). Easy mode reads tenants, tables, and filter strips as the choices they are, reads a listing rendered as buttons, reads through `display: contents`, and never puts script text in notices. `axe surface coverage --state` reuses a saved sign-in and reads each page once it settles.
- Easy mode reads a lone row named for an item (a folder holding one subfolder, `connector_test`) as opening that item, not an unrecognized high-risk change.
